There, you will find the details of your assigned Mentees.\n\nWe ask that you reach out to your respective Mentees as a priority, keeping in mind all the points discussed during the Mentor Orientation session.\nPlease ensure that you send meeting invites through the SMP portal to keep a record of your meetings with them.\nWe expect you to have a minimum of two meetings each month, but more frequent meetings are encouraged. You can choose to meet them as a group or individually, depending on the comfort level of your Mentees.\n\nIf you encounter any difficulties in contacting your Mentees, please bring this to our attention promptly. As a Student Mentor, you play a crucial role in guiding and supporting first-year M.Tech and B.Tech students throughout their initial academic year at IIITD.\n\nIf you have any issues or need assistance, the MRB members are always here to support and guide you.\n\n---\n\nPlease note that the budget limit for SMP Mentor-Mentee meetings is Rs. 300 per person per semester. For example, in a group with one Mentor and four Mentees, the group can spend up to Rs. 1500 in one or multiple meetings during the semester, based on their preferences.\n\nThe step-by-step process for reimbursement of expenses for Mentor-Mentee meetings is as follows:\n\n1. After your meetings, please collect the bills and have them signed by your Mentees. It is preferable to have the bills issued in the name of IIIT-Delhi.\n2. To initiate reimbursement, the Mentor should email me and the SMP faculty of their respective department, CCing all the Mentees who attended the meeting. The email must include at least one photograph of the meeting with all participants and a soft copy or picture of the bill as attachments.\n3. The Mentor must bring the original bill and a Xerox copy (required by the accounts section as the ink on bills tends to fade quickly) to my office in A206, Academic Block, for reimbursement.\n4. Bills must be submitted for reimbursement within one month of the date on the bill.\n\nIf you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to get in touch.\n\nWishing you all the best.\n\nThanks and Regards,\n\nKhushpinder P.

Starting today, your assigned Mentor will be reaching out to you, so please keep an eye on your inbox and respond promptly.\n\nYour Mentor is expected to have at least two meetings with you each month, but more frequent meetings are encouraged, based on your convenience.

You can directly contact the SMP Faculty In-charge of your department or the Well-being Cell.\n\nStudent Mentors are also expected to offer you refreshments (within the defined budget limits) during your meetings, and we will reimburse the expenses for these.\n\nWe encourage you to make the most of the Student Mentorship Program and create meaningful connections and memories along the way.\n\nYou can now access your Student Mentorâ€™s details through the portal.
